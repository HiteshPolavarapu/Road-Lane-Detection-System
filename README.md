# Road-Lane-Detection-System
This repository implements lane detection for self-driving cars using classical computer vision techniques such as Canny edge detection, Hough transform, and perspective transforms with sliding window search for curved lanes. The system processes videos frame-by-frame and overlays detected lanes in real time.
